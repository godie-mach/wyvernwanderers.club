## Origin Story
##### "Magical cat"
A feylinx with salt and pepper fur, a long beard like tuft on its snout. Most strikingly, it has seven tails. Was held prisoner in [[Tresendar Manor]] by [[Mayor Harbin Wester]]. His right arm was severed below his elbow. Former mayor of [[Phandalin]]. Previously held [[Talon]] (from [[Tresendar Manor]]). We also learned most of what we know of the [[Phandelver Pact]] from him.
