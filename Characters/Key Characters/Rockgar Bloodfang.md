## Origin Story
##### "Bloodfang Tribe Chieftan"
Large tattoed [orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16972-orc) and current chief of the [[Bloodfang Clan]]. His mother was a [giant](https://officialbestiary.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_(D%26D) and dad was [[Gurk Bloodfang]]. [[Xerov, the white dragon|Xerov]] killed Gurk. The [[Bloodfang Clan]] did not accept Rockhard as their new leader. After [[Gurk Bloodfang|Gurk]]'s death, [[Gorok Bloodfang]] became temporary clan leader and, technically, usurper. He is Rockgar's uncle. Now, Rockgar has killed the dragon (with our help) and by tradition, has killed [[Gorok Bloodfang]] to take over as Tribe King.
