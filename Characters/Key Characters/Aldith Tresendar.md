## Origin Story
##### "The Black Hawk"
The owner of  [[Tresendar Manor]]. An unusually large halfling knight that carried [[Talon]]. A sword with its hilt worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. Fought in [[World History#The Foundry Wars|The Foundry Wars]]. Within the manor, we found he owned textbooks that had notes to open the cave. Notes mentioned we _"must reunite the arms of [[Phandelver Pact]]."_ Aldrith mentioned [[Cassia]]. She left him because of some event that happened in the [[Echo Cave]]. [[Gurk Bloodfang]] and [[Lox]] betrayed him and stole Talon.
