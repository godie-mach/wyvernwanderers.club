#### Main Quest Summary
The adventurers first gathered in Neverwinter, each with their own quirks: [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]], a plucky gnome rogue; [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]], a tall and slender half elf druid. [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]], a human paladin with the scent of ale clinging to him; and [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], a mysterious blue skinned Drow ranger. They were recruited by [[Gundren Rockseeker]], a charismatic dwarf, to escort his caravan to [[Phandalin]]. [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] mentioned feeling watched and asked [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] to meet him in [[Phandalin]] for further details. The journey began smoothly until they stumbled upon signs of an ambush, discovering that [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] and his companion [[Syldar Hallwinter]] had been attacked. The party was ambushed by goblins but managed to fend them off and track them to a hideout, where they freed [[Syldar Hallwinter]]. [[Syldar Hallwinter]] explained that [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] had stopped to help a young girl, who transformed into a creature that ambushed them. 

Arriving in [[Phandalin]], the party encountered [[The Redbrand]], a gang harassing the locals. [[Elmer]], a half-orc ally, informed them that [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]],  were scouting the [[Sword Mountains]] and had not returned. In town, the group met [[Mayor Harbin Wester]], who dismissed concerns about [[The Redbrand]], and [[Linene]], the town blacksmith, who reluctantly agreed to shelter [[Mung and Drool|Mung]], a goblin the party had saved. She urged the group to confront [[The Redbrand]]. At the [[Sleeping Giant Pub]], a skirmish broke out with [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] thugs, forcing the party to flee. [[Darren Eldermath]], a local with a mysterious past, offered them shelter and guided them through secret tunnels to avoid further confrontation. He shared tales of his youth and the town’s troubles under [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] control, revealing his hope that the party might change things.

The group’s next task was to investigate an abandoned mansion rumored to be a [[The Redbrand|Redbrand]] hideout. They discovered [[Urno Albrek]], a former comrade of [[Syldar Hallwinter]] now leading the gang under the alias [[Urno Albrek|Glass staff]]. After a fierce battle, they captured [[Urno Albrek|Glass staff]], who revealed his true identity before falling unconscious. The group also freed prisoners, including a young [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] recruit who shared information about the gang’s operations. They were confronted by [[Aldo]], the Redbrand’s second-in-command, who ultimately chose to release the prisoners and consider a different path, encouraged by the party’s arguments against blindly following the gang’s leadership. [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] also reunited with [[Nundro Rockseeker]], [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren's]] brother, who shared more of [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren's]] dangerous quest to locate a mysterious relic.

[[Syldar Hallwinter]] provided a lead on [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren's]]  location but needed help from the party to locate [[Urno Albrek]], believed to be investigating a ruined mansion. The party decided to search for [[Thundertree]]’s druid, [[Reidoth]], hoping he could provide the Harrow Root, a rare herb required to break a spell on one of [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren's]] brothers. Arriving in [[Thundertree]], they found the town plagued by strange vegetation and zombies, along with [[Venom Fang, the green dragon]]. [[Reidoth]], a reclusive druid, agreed to supply the herb if the party helped rid the town of the dragon. Disguising themselves as cultists, they attempted to trick [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]] into eating poisoned food, but chaos erupted when a [[Masked Frog Humanoid|masked figure]] stole an artifact from the dragon’s hoard, angering it. In the ensuing battle, [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] transformed into a monstrous black dragon, briefly overpowering [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]] but losing control, devastating [[Thundertree]] as the party barely escaped.

Shaken but determined, the group continued their mission, tracking [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]]  in her dragon form to a nearby village where they encountered [[Wyre]], a clan leader who warned them of deadly forest dangers. Retrieving [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]]  after her transformation, they returned to [[Phandalin]], where [[Nundro]] treated his brother with the Harrow Root. [[Syldar Hallwinter]] and the townsfolk expressed their gratitude, while the party prepared for the next leg of their quest, now aware of [[The Black Spider|The Black Spider's]] growing influence and the role they would play in defending [[Phandalin]].

Through [[Pytr]] we learn about the [[Echo Cave]] and [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren's]] pursuit of it. Long ago, this land was inhabited by three opposing tribes: [[Hotenow Tribe]], the druid clan, and [[Bloodfang Clan|The Bloodfang Clan]] (ancestors of [[Rockgar Bloodfang]]). [[Aldith Tresendar]] came to this region to forge a pact between all three packs to find the Echo Cave. According to ancient lore, the Echo Cave can create magical items and riches, including aethercite. Aethercite is an extremely powerful, illegal and highly volatile substance. Whoever obtains access to forge this stuff would achieve tremendous power. ***The druids made a pact with the orcs because the Hotenow tribe are in danger?*** However, an orc army laid waste to the cave and the entrance was closed/hidden. Those who believe it exists say a key is required to enter. The "key" is also known as the [[Phandelver Pact]] and it is a collection of weapons and artifacts. This knowledge came from [[Pytr]].

On one of our many side quests, we rescue [[Pickle]] from the hands of [[Vyerlyth]]. [[Pickle]] contained knowledge about the Echo Cave but was sworn to secrecy by [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]]. While in our care, she comes into contact with [[Talon]], part of the [[Phandelver Pact]]. She projects an image of a lush, green and vivid landscape. We see two humanoid male figures: one has broad, black hair and [[Aldith Tresendar]]. We also see regal elf woman with tan skin and [[Lox]]. Finally, we see [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits]], who declares: “the beginnings of this journey needs a title”. [[Pickle]] is being held by the Toggle. Deep-green body passes through our line of sight. 

 Later on, when we obtain the staff that's part of the [[Phandelver Pact]], [[Pickle]] projects another image: Deep in the mountains, we are surrounded by thick leather tents. Then [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits]] says [[Aldith Tresendar]] needs to "watch his step." We again see [[Lox]] holding a pair of daggers, a regal elf holding the emerald staff, [[Boggle Figgle-Wiggits]] holding his leather bound book, [[Aldith Tresendar]] holding [[Talon]] and [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits]] holding a satchel and a hammer.
