### The Epoch of Divine Honor and Scientific Rebellion

The land began to descend into civil conflict as the highborn, claiming to be the first children of the gods, believed they alone understood the proper way to wield magic. To them, magic was a divine gift, meant to remain sacred and never to be mixed with technology. They feared that merging the two would defile the gods' gift, bringing calamity and, eventually, destruction to the world.

In contrast, the second children—known as the people to be shepherded—rose in rebellion. They saw magic as a tool, not a divine inheritance, and believed that combining it with technology would improve their way of life. Restricting its use, they argued, only harmed the common folk, who were otherwise denied access to magic’s benefits. In their eyes, this defiance would not anger the gods, but rather unlock magic's true potential for all.

### The Foundry Wars

The conflict reached a turning point when the rebellion achieved a breakthrough in technology, discovering how to manufacture "Aethercite"—a powerful substance coveted by the first children that had long given them a stranglehold over the "shepherded." This discovery drastically shifted the balance of power between the common folk and the highborn. Foundries, where Aethercite was produced, began springing up across all the highborn kingdoms.

Tensions finally erupted when the High Magistrates and highborn loyalists attempted to shut down a foundry in one of the major kingdoms. The confrontation spiraled into chaos, with violent clashes between the purists and the rebels. The conflict culminated in the foundry's explosion, killing many from both sides. This tragedy plunged the land into inevitable civil war, pitting the first children against the rebellion.

The war came to be known as the Foundry Wars, named after the many foundries built to fuel the rebellion’s fight against the High Magistrates' forces.

### Cataclysm

The feud raged on for years, with each side gaining and losing ground, neither able to fully overpower the other. In the end, it all came down to a final, catastrophic event. Both sides, desperate to gain the upper hand, used every last ounce of Aethercite to channel beams of pure magic at each other. When the two beams collided, it triggered a cataclysmic explosion.

The result was devastating: a massive blast engulfed the entire kingdom, encapsulating the land in crystal. Those closest to the explosion were transformed into pure energy, feeding back into the blast and causing it to burn for three days before finally extinguishing itself. Those further from the center were turned to solid crystal.

Now, the kingdom remains locked in a sea of blue crystal, a permanent reminder of the devastating scale the war had reached—and a warning to those who would ever push it to such extremes again.

### The Truce Accords of the Grand Ascension

Following the cataclysmic event, a summit was convened between the High Magistrates, the first children of the most regal families, and the rebels, who had rebranded themselves as the “Free Borns.” These factions controlled the most powerful foundries and sought to establish a lasting peace. 

The summit lasted for many months as both sides worked toward an agreement. The Free Borns consented to the shutdown of all civil foundries and the outlawing of any common folk manufacturing of Aethercite. Distribution of Aethercite was to be approved solely by the respective factions. However, in a compromise, common folk, regardless of race or creed, were granted the right to use magic and combine it with technology within the bounds set by the gods.

The highborns and High Magistrates concluded that the only way to allow the common folk to live freely was to separate from the land. The rebels agreed that the High Magistrates could retain their remaining Aethercite reserves to ascend into the sky, a process referred to as the Grand Ascension. In this agreement, it was established that the land would belong to the Free Borns, while the sky lands would belong to the Firsts.

### The Age of Heroes

In the aftermath of the Foundry Wars, the mainland was populated by many heroes, their deeds immortalized in tales and songs celebrating their bravery in battle. This era marked a pivotal time in shaping the land into what we recognize today, with families rising and falling in prominence. Heroes composed new ballads recounting their adventures and exploits, while some ventured off to seek their own fortunes and kingdoms.


During this age, we encounter a tall halfling and his trusted dwarf companion, both striving to create new songs of their own.
