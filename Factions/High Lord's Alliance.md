## History
##### "Motto"
We have met a couple of characters associated with the High Lord's Alliance, including [[Garaele]] (Sister of [[The Luck Shrine]]) and [[Syldar Hallwinter]]. The brotherhood uses a brand depicting a shepherd's cane with vines curling up the base of the staff.  I ti smeant to represent a brotherhood of warriors meant to protect the weak, whom he refers to as lambs. [[Syldar Hallwinter]] had a vision “calling lights” to find people he had previously been in the High Lord's Alliance with. "Great evil coming." ^ba9d20
