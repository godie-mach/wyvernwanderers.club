[[Xerov, the white dragon]] is defeated. Seshat was mortally wounded. However, she recovered _myseriously_. She's now in a good state but, keep in mind, she previously messed with an artifact that has its own intentions ðŸ‘€. Seshat doesn't know how she recovered either.Â After defeating the dragon, Rockgar and the squad take the dragon's head back to the [[Bloodfang Clan]], where we fight [[Gorok Bloodfang]] the usurper to retake Rockgar's throne. Rockgar expresses that defeat defeating Gorok is only the beginning since he has to regain the tribe's trust. Rockgar and [[The Adventurers|Levana]] share a few intimate moments, and before the squad's departure, Rockgar expresses his fondness for her and will await her return. 

The squad returns to [[Urno Albrek]], who rewards us for defeating the dragon by giving us a book and [[Squad Inventory#^746f72|a fancy candle]]. We run into [[Piggie]], who offers us some shrooms. Levana abstains from consuming the mushrooms. Rowan and Clank begin writhing in pain, while Levana is able to soberly witness what is happening. Seshat's eyes turn green and [[Vyerlyth]] appears and takes Seshat. A portal opens and [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp]] appears where [[Piggie]] was standing, along with a mangey [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]]. After a long fight and a few close calls, the displacer beast is defeated, but prior to defeating [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]], [[Masked Frog Humanoid|the masked figure]] pops out of a portal and grabs [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]] back. He kicks and screams, insisting he can do it, but alas he is taken by [[Masked Frog Humanoid|the masked figure]]. The displacer beast turns into this goo-like substance. However, it feels like a piece of jerky when touched. Someone in the science field may be able to help analyze it further. 

The adventurers returned to town to investigate the peculiar [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]] jerky they had acquired. Upon arrival, they encountered [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]] speaking with [[The Adventurers#Kreeble|Kreeble]], a chatty and persuasive gnome seeking work. Intrigued, the group enlisted [[The Adventurers#Kreeble|Kreeble]]â€™s help to locate [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]], who could analyze the jerky. Storm clouds gathered, heralding the arrival of a dramatic envoy led by [[Godric Gallavant Grimor]], a bronze dragonborn with an entourage of soldiers and diplomats. [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]] dismissed the pomp, focusing instead on meeting [[Garaele|Sister Garaele]] and overseeing preparations for a festival. The group also met [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]], a philanthropic tiefling in simple white garb. [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]]â€™s calm demeanor and altruistic nature immediately impressed the group, prompting them to welcome her assistance. Meanwhile, tensions arose as [[The Adventurers#Mina|Mina]], a tiefling, was thrown out of the armory while searching for [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]]. The group eventually found [[Nundro]], who needed his chemistry setâ€”retrieved with [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]]'s helpâ€”to investigate the jerky. 

As the festival unfolded, the adventurers were covertly summoned by an acrobatic dragonborn, who warned them to avoid an overseer elf while entering [[The Luck Shrine]]. Inside, they were transported to a grand library where they met [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]], [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]], and others. [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]]â€™s analysis revealed the jerky contained petrified wood from [[Mount Hotenow]], leading [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] to suspect [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] was being held there. [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]] explained he could not deploy guards without political repercussions, using the festival as a cover for his investigation. The group resolved to assist, with [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]] volunteering for the mission and [[The Adventurers#Mina|Mina]] assisting with locating [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]]. As they prepared for their journey, the mystery deepened, and their sights turned toward the ominous [[Mount Hotenow]].
