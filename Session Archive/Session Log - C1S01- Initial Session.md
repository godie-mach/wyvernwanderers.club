## Session Summary (Transcribed)

A band of adventurers gathers in a pub in the small docking town of [[Neverwinter]]. The group consists of: 
- [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]], a plucky gnome rogue with a mustache
- [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]], a tall and slender half-elf druid
- [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]], a human paladin with the scent of ale clinging to him
- [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], a mysterious blue skinned drow ranger. 

They are brought together by a charismatic bald dwarf named [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and his companion, [[Syldar Hallwinter]], a warrior wielding two giant scimitars sheathed on his back. [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] introduces himself and explains that he assembled the group to help escort a caravan to the small mining town of [[Phandalin]], concerned that he's being watched. He wants to ensure his equipment doesn't fall into the wrong hands. 

[[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] assures them that the journey will be simple and that they won't face any attacks. [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] informs the party that he and [[Syldar Hallwinter]] will leave immediately if any danger arises, and that they will reconvene in [[Phandalin]] for their payment. 

Later, [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] pulls [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] aside, revealing that he specifically invited him into the group, saying _"nothing is exactly as it seems. I'll explain more when we meet again in [[Phandalin]]."_

The party then turns in for the night, planning to reconvene in the morning.
