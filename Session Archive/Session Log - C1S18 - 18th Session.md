## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party moves cautiously into the forest, which at first appears no different from any other they’ve encountered. But as they venture deeper, they notice the tree trunks gradually shifting from a rich brown to a dull, stony grey, until they find themselves surrounded by trees frozen in time, fully transformed into a brittle, petrified forest.

Following the trail of destruction, they eventually come upon a massive clearing where shattered stone trees lie strewn around a large crater. At the center, they spot [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], unconscious and unmoving. In the distance, a low hiss echoes through the forest, sending a shiver down their spines. Wasting no time, they lift [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]]'s lifeless form and make their way out of the eerie stone forest before any new threats can emerge.

Once in a safe location, they manage to rouse [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]]. She opens her eyes slowly, looking weary, and confesses a final dark secret. She explains that within her resides an uncontrollable entity, one that can escape and unleash destruction when she loses consciousness. _“If I’m ever out cold,”_ she warns, _“I can’t stop it. It will tear through anything in its path.”_
