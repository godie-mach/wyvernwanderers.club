## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party enters [[Thundertree]], a ruined, rundown town overrun by strange, monstrous vegetation and dust zombies that shuffle aimlessly through the streets. As they cautiously investigate the area, a wary [[Venom Fang, the green dragon| green scaled creature]] suddenly swoops above them, flying casually toward the tallest tower in the center of town.

Making their way through the eerie settlement, the party spots a hut with barred windows and a weathered sign reading _"[[Reidoth]]'s Medicinal Herbs and Supplements."_ They knock but only hear snoring from within. After a few louder bangs on the door, the occupant stirs.

_“All right, all right. Hold your horses,”_ grumbles a voice from inside. The door opens to reveal a tall druid with an open robe, tinted glasses, and an air of annoyance.

[[Reidoth]] invites the party into his hut, eyeing them with suspicion. _“All right, what do you lot want? The [[Reidoth]] special?”_ he asks, bringing out a small musky-smelling box.

When the party explains their need for Harrow Root, [[Reidoth]] agrees to help, but only for a steep price of ten thousand gold or, alternatively, if they take care of a young green dragon that’s made its lair in [[Thundertree|the town’s]] highest tower. _“Dragons are bad for business,”_ he mutters.

The party agrees to face the dragon, and [[Reidoth]] suggests that if they need more information, they should seek out a group of dragon cultists in town who serve [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|the green dragon]], following an old and dangerous religion.

The party tracks down the green dragon cultists and intimidates them, extracting as much information as possible about [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|the green dragon]]. Afterward, they release the cultists, most of whom flee the town immediately, except one—a follower named Dennis. They convince Dennis to head back to [[Phandalin]], suggesting he could find a better life than serving a dragon who treats them like dirt.

From the cultists, the party learns that [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|the green dragon]] enjoys receiving wooden offerings and food. With this knowledge, they devise a plan. They’ll disguise themselves as cultists and trick the dragon into eating poisoned food, giving them an advantage in the upcoming fight.
