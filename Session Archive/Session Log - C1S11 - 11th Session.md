## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The group searches the cave and eventually finds a room filled with vials, beakers, and a makeshift laboratory. Among the clutter, they discover a diary detailing an investigation of the [[Tresendar Manor|mansion]] and [[Aldith Tresendar]], commissioned by an elven woman named [[Vyerlyth]] on behalf of someone known as [[The Black Spider]]. They realize the diary was written by [[Urno Albrek|Urno]], the man [[Syldar Hallwinter]] had urged them to locate.

Their investigation is interrupted when a [[Urno Albrek|red-clad magician wielding a glass staff]] confronts them. He introduces himself as [[Urno Albrek|Glass staff]], leader of [[The Redbrand]]. After a fierce battle, the party subdues [[Urno Albrek|Glass staff]], bringing him to the brink of death and even severing his hand. Removing his mask, they find a gaunt, sickly-looking man who gasps awake, weakly identifying himself as [[Urno Albrek|Urno]] before passing out again.

As they prepare to leave with [[Urno]]'s unconscious body, a large group of [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] members appears at the caveâ€™s entrance. Leading them is a masked halfling with olive skin, flanked by a few [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] thugs who are dragging along an unconscious dwarf and another bound prisoner.

_"Levana!"_ the dwarven prisoner exclaims in shock upon seeing the party, inadvertently alerting the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] to their presence.
