## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party returned to town to regroup and investigate the strange [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]] jerky they had acquired. Upon arrival, they spotted [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]] conversing with a gnome. Clank, recalling his distinguished family back in Xeno, immediately recognized the gnome as a forest gnome rather than a rock gnome. Meanwhile, [[Elmer]] stood nearby, scanning the horizon as storm clouds began to gather.

_"I've been under the weather lately. Oofus and Doofus haven't been pulling their weight,"_ [[Elmer]] grumbled. _"You all treat my horses well?"_ He gestured expectantly for payment. Respecting the deal, the group handed over 10 gold per rider (a total of 30 gold) and returned the horses.

Turning back to [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]] and [[The Adventurers#Kreeble Reachbottom|the gnome]], the party learned the gnome's name was [[The Adventurers#Kreeble Reachbottom|Kreeble Reachbottom]]. He is a chatty, charismatic figure eager to find work. A former adventuring companion of [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]], Kreeble claimed to have a knack for persuasion and a distaste for violence. Intrigued, the group offered him a trial assignment: help them locate a scientist who might know more about the [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]] jerky.

[[Darren Eldermath|Darren]] recommended speaking to [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]]. As the storm intensified, [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] sensed something unnatural—perhaps arcane in nature. The storm soon transformed, spiraling like a hurricane. At its center, a stone-like vehicle descended and landed west of [[The Luck Shrine]].

From the vehicle, a glowing crystal emitted light, and a door materialized. A group of well-armored elves marched out, wearing ornate, almond-shaped helmets resembling the crystal. They formed a catwalk as a smaller elf, clad in skin-tight pantaloons, stepped forward.

_"Now, forthcomes the lord of all crops, one of the united islands of Zenith, bearing gifts to uphold prosperity. The benevolent, Godric Gallavant Grimoir!"_ the elf announced, their voice echoing theatrically.

Suddenly, a voice interrupted: _"Alright, alright! Enough of that."_

Emerging from the vehicle was [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]], a bronze dragonborn dressed in plain clothes. He seemed embarrassed and annoyed by the pomp, commanding his soldiers to stand down. Behind him, a tall, slender elf glided out, followed by two dragonborn soldiers clad in brilliant armor. One, a black dragonborn, was introduced as [[Typhoon]]. A striking [[Lightning|tiefling with mismatched eyes]] followed, and stumbling behind them was another [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|tiefling, wide-eyed and dressed in white religious garb.]]

[[Godric]] approached [[Garaele|Sister Garaele]] at [[The Luck Shrine]] and embraced her warmly. Meanwhile, [[Typhoon]] declared the shrine off-limits. [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] attempted to negotiate entry but was ignored.

Nearby, shouting erupted as [[Linene]] ejected a tiefling, [[Mina]], from the armory, yelling, _"Go away, you devil creatures!"_

Intrigued, the group questioned [[Mina]]. She revealed she was searching for [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] to collect on a loan. With few answers, [[Mina]] stalked off to continue her search.

Later, [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]] offered her help, claiming her only goal was to support others. Suspicious but willing to accept aid, the party sent her to [[The Luck Shrine]] to inquire about [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]]. She learned from the dragonborn guards that [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and others had been evicted. Nearby, a stout, ginger-haired gnome was napping on a barrel.

_"Are you [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]]?"_ [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]] asked.

_"Indeed, I am,"_ he replied.

[[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]] escorted [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] to the group. They presented the [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]] jerky, piquing his curiosity. He explained he needed his old chemistry set to investigate further—but it was still inside [[The Luck Shrine]]. [[The Adventurers#Kreeble Reachbottom|Kreeble]] volunteered to charm his way in but failed. [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]] ultimately secured entry, and together with [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], they retrieved the set.

[[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] began his analysis, concocting a substance that needed to cool before revealing its secrets.

While waiting, the town bustled with preparations for a grand festival orchestrated by the pantalooned elves and dragonborn. [[Typhoon]] dismissed questions about its purpose, saying only that it honored [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|all-father]] and his benevolence.

During the festival, a curvy dragonborn pulled the group aside into a tent. Inside, a masked acrobat performed a dazzling display of strength and agility. Mid-performance, she whispered to them:

_"The [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|all-father]] has requested your presence in [[The Luck Shrine]]. If you enter openly, it will draw too much attention. Avoid the overseer elf at all costs."_

After the show, the team regrouped and devised a plan. [[The Adventurers#Kreeble Reachbottom|Kreeble]] distracted the guard with a spellbound poetry recital, allowing [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]], [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]], and others to sneak through the shrine’s doors.

Inside, the acrobatic dragonborn created a fiery circle around them, transporting them to a grand circular library.

In the library, they found [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]], [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]], [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]], [[Pytr]], and [[Lightning]]. [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]] inquired about [[The Black Spider]] and what the team knew.

_"One of the dwarven brothers may have a lead,"_ he said.

[[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] stepped forward with the substance he concocted earlier: _"Petrified wood! It’s from the forests of [[Mount Hotenow]]."_

[[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] growled, _"Those bastards are holding my brother [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] there."_

[[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]] explained he could not send guards without committing treason. Instead, he had staged the festival as a cover for his investigation. [[The Adventurers#Sarhiri|Sarhiri]] volunteered to assist. Though reluctant, [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]] allowed it, urging her to stay safe.

The group prepared for their next move, the mysteries deepening as they looked toward [[Mount Hotenow]].
