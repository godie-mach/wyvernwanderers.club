## Session Summary (Transcribed)

[[Xerov, the white dragon]] is defeated. [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] was mortally wounded. However, she recovered _mysteriously_. She's now in a good state but, keep in mind, she previously messed with an artifact that has its own intentions ðŸ‘€. [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] doesn't know how she recovered either.Â After defeating the dragon, [[Rockgar Bloodfang]] and the squad take the dragon's head back to the [[Bloodfang Clan]], where we fight [[Gorok Bloodfang]] the usurper to retake [[Rockgar Bloodfang]]'s throne. [[Rockgar Bloodfang]] expresses that defeat defeating [[Gorok Bloodfang]] is only the beginning since he has to regain the tribe's trust. [[Rockgar Bloodfang]] and [[The Adventurers|Levana]] share a few intimate moments, and before the squad's departure, [[Rockgar Bloodfang]] expresses his fondness for her and will await her return. 

The squad returns to [[Urno Albrek]], who rewards us for defeating the dragon by giving us a book and [[Squad Inventory#^746f72|a fancy candle]]. We run into [[Piggie]], who offers us some shrooms. [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] abstains from consuming the mushrooms. [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] and [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] begin writhing in pain, while [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] is able to soberly witness what is happening. Seshat's eyes turn green and [[Vyerlyth]] appears before us.
