## Session Summary (Transcribed)

Venturing deeper, the party eventually finds themselves in a vast catacomb. A thick fog fills the air, headstones line the walls, and a statue of a knight stands with its arm outstretched, clenched hand empty, as if it once held something valuable.

While examining the room, they notice a glimmer as a gold ring with a shimmering green gem falls to the ground. As they pick it up, strange whispers echo from the ceiling. Looking up, they spot a one-eyed creature grinning at them. It blinks, casting a green light across the room, and scurries along the ceiling before vanishing through a doorway. The door slams shut behind it, and suddenly, hands and bodies begin clawing their way out of the floor.

Soon, the party is surrounded by decomposed, halfling-sized creatures, each with hollowed faces screeching, _"Return the Talon!"_ 

The party fights the ghouls, but for each one they defeat, the creatures reform and attack again. Overwhelmed, they eventually escape, slamming the door shut as the undead surge back into the room.

Intrigued by the ring, [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] slips it onto her finger. Immediately, a wave of energy surges through her, heightening her senses. Her hearing sharpens, and her vision becomes exceptionally clear. Using her newfound abilities, she helps the party locate a hidden passage at the end of the basement, leading to an open cave.
