## Session Summary (Transcribed)

Upon the party's return to [[Phandalin]], they reunite with [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]], [[Harrow Root]] in hand. Wasting no time, [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] grinds the root into a paste, carefully smearing it over the eyes of the sleeping [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]. A tense silence fills the room until [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]'s eyelids begin to twitch in discomfort. Moments later, he bolts upright, clutching at his face.

_"My eyes!"_ he cries. _"It stings!"_ [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] quickly grabs water to help wash the [[Harrow Root]] paste from his brother's eyes. [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] blinks, his expression shifting to one of distress.

_"My sight. It's hazy. I can't see,"_ he murmurs, panicked. [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] places a reassuring hand on [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]'s shoulder. _"It's just a side effect, brother. Your sight will return in time, but you need to rest."_

Once [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] begins to settle, [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] fills him in on the situation. _"[[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] is still missing,"_ he explains, _"but [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] and her companions are already on the trail. You need to regain your strength until you're ready to join us again."_

Leaving the room, [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] informs the group that [[Elmer]] has something for them and would like to talk to them.
