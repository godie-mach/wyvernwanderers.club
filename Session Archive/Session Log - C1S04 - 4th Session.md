## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party agrees and heads toward the [[Sleeping Giant Pub]], where they were told [[The Redbrand]] hang out. Upon arriving at the saloon, they see several [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] lounging on the railing and sitting on barrels. Their clothes are ragged, some wearing crimson masks or hoods. It's clear they're drunk. The red-clad rogues spot the group and begin jeering.

_"Woo-hoo! Look at that tall one!"_ one of them slurs. _"Think I'm man enough to climb those heights?!"_ 

Another, eyeing a blue-skinned party member, sneers. _"You can have the odd looking one. But I doubt you can do any better."_ One of the men elbows his companion in the ribs, and the whole group bursts into raucous laughter. 

Without hesitation, [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] draws her bow, and a skirmish breaks out. More [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] members pour out of the pub, along with a stout dwarven woman in an apron, who looks on in shock at the violent scene unfolding outside. 

Outnumbered, the party decides to retreat, aiming to escape as more of the gang gathers. In the distance, a figure in a red coat waves urgently to the party.

_"Hurry!"_ he urges. 

The party follows him to a nearby tree, where he stands waiting. _"I saw what you did to those red scoundrels. Jolly good,"_ he says with a nod and a smirk, flashing glimpses of gold and silver teeth. _"Trust me and I'll help you escape."_ 

He turns to the tree and whispers, _"Minois oue,"_ causing the bark to peel away and reveal an opening large enough for them to pass through.

_"Hurry! Jump in while you can, or you'll be caught for sure,"_ he says, darting into the hidden passage. 

The party quickly follows him into the tree.
