## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The group pushes open a hatch that leads into the farmlands. As they emerge they spot a [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] thug resting against a fence. Surprised to see the group crawling out of the ground, the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] thug attempts to escape. [[Darren Eldermath]] quickly pulls out his banjo and strums loudly in the thug's direction. The powerful vibration stops the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] thug dead in his tracks.

[[Darren Eldermath]] approaches, restrains him and brings him back to the group. _"Now what should we do with you, eh?"_ [[Darren Eldermath]] questions. 

_"Let me go and I won't say a word, I swear,"_ the thug pleads. [[Darren Eldermath]] sighs. _"These are just street kids from the Neverwinter Docks, trying to scrape by, never knowing what good or bad will come their way,"_ he says to the group. 

_"Always a champion of the people, eh, [[Darren Eldermath]]?"_ 

A soft, pleasant voice surprises the group. They turn to see the speaker, a strikingly attractive woman. Her curves are accentuated by carefully chosen clothing and her sun-kissed caramel skin is warm and inviting. Her elegant cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes are nicely framed by a bob haircut. 

_"You know me, [[Halleah]]. Always a fool to think even the roughest have some good in them, for better or worse,"_ [[Darren Eldermath]] replies with a sly sneer, clearly indicating a shared history. [[Darren Eldermath]] turns back to the group and hands the prisoner to [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]]. 

_"I leave the decision in your capable hands. I must return to my farm and ensure it hasn't been ransacked in my absence."_ He nods to [[Halleah]], who smirks in response. 

_"He has a good heart, but he just doesn't truly understand how the world works, and maybe he's just a little too soft,"_ [[Halleah]] says, shaking her head. _"But you lot don't seem soft at all. I heard rumblings of some commotion at the [[Sleeping Giant Pub]]. Safe to assume that was your fancy work? Perhaps you can investigate something for me,"_ she continues, her smirk widening like a cat cornering a mouse. 

_"I've heard the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] leader is some sort of mage clad in red and holds a glass staff. Can you find out who that is and deal with him? Also, I need you to spare the life of his right-hand man, a creature called [[Aldo]]. I would love to hear his tales of how he rose through the ranks to run the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]]."_ 

The party questions their new prisoner about the [[Urno Albrek|glass-staffed mage]] and [[Aldo]]. He claims to be a new recruit and admits he doesn't know much. Upon closer inspection, they realize he is much younger than they initially expected. He has never met the mage, but has seen [[Aldo]] in passing. The prisoner reveals that [[Aldo]] is a halfling who commands respect among the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]]. He mentions a hideout where the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] meet, a run-down mansion outside of town, but he has never been there himself. He swears that's all he knows.

The group huddles to discuss whether they should let him go or not. Rowan asks the boy's name. _"Forest,"_ he replies, his voice cracking as he pleads with the group. _"I promise I'll run back to Neverwinter and never be heard from again."_ After some deliberation, the group decides to let the boy go, pushing him to the ground. 

_"Thank you,"_ he exclaims as he scrambles away. Suddenly, [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] pulls out his bow gun, takes aim, and fires. The bolt flies through the air, striking Forest in the kneecap. He screams in pain, and the party hears him whimpering. _"Why?"_ [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] holsters his bow gun, and the group leaves the area, the sounds of the boys' faint cries echoing behind them.
