## Session Summary (Transcribed)

Upon returning to the center of [[Phandalin|town]], in front of [[The Luck Shrine]], the party sees [[Syldar Hallwinter]] speaking with [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]]. [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]] shakes his head and lifts his shoulders in disappointment at [[Syldar Hallwinter]]. 

When he notices the group, he quickly bows to [[Syldar Hallwinter]] and hurries away, hiding his face. Unfazed by the [[Mayor Harbin Wester|mayor's]] odd behavior, [[Syldar Hallwinter]] approaches the party.

_"Come, I have arranged lodging at the Stone Hill Inn. There I will explain my findings and the aid I need from you."_ [[Syldar Hallwinter]] says, in a raspy, commanding voice. At the inn, [[Syldar Hallwinter]] reveals to the group that he was once part of an organization called the [[High Lords Alliance]]. He shows them a brand depicting a shepherd's cane with vines curling up the base of the staff; aa symbol of a brotherhood of warriors meant to protect the weak, whom he refers to as the lambs of saloon. 

This group has been disbanded for many years. Recently, he claims to have received a vision known as the guiding light, warning him of an impending calamity. He feels compelled to travel across the plains and recruit warriors to confront this threat. Knowing only some of his former comrades, he embarked on a journey to find them. He shares that he took [[Gundren|Gundren's]] job to reach [[Phandalin]], where he heard his brother in arms, [[Urno Albrek]], was last seen. 

However, people in the area haven't seen [[Urno Albrek|Urno]] for quite some time, especially after he went to investigate a [[Tresendar Manor| ruined mansion outside of town.]] [[Syldar Hallwinter]], torn by his responsibilities, asks the group for help. While he needs to find and rescue [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], he pleads with the group to locate [[Urno Albrek|Urno]] while he can gather a lead on [[Gundren]]'s whereabouts,
