## Session Summary (Transcribed)

A magical projection shoots out of [[Pickle|Pickle's]] eyes. _"Here you are,"_ a high-pitched, slightly gruff voice emits from [[Pickle]]. The projection begins to display a series of images. A lush green landscape comes into view. Amid the vibrant scenery, two figures scout ahead. The images are sharp and vivid, as if recorded by a master spell caster or someone truly skilled in their craft.

The projection then shifts, focusing on the ashen, oil-marked face of a [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits|young rock gnome girl.]] _"The beginning of a lofty journey,"_ the gnome smiles, _"needing an encouraging title."_

The view swiftly rotates, now showing a tall, [[Cassia|beautiful elf with amber skin.]] Caught off guard, the elf looks down in confusion, her face softening into an awkward smile. She's about to speak whenâ€”

_"Toys do not belong on the battlefield,"_ a commanding voice interrupts as the projection is forcefully directed toward the ground.

_"Away!"_ the gnome shouts in protest.

The projection jerks back up, now focusing on the back of a [[Lox|woman with a bright, blood-red mohawk.]]

_"You'd be smarter to keep a keen eye instead of worrying about a keen title,"_ the [[Lox|mohawked woman]] barks as she moves past the two figures.

_"A little brash, but she's right,"_ [[Cassia|the elf]] says, her tone calmer. The projection focuses back on her.

_"This is Orc country now,"_ she continues, scanning the area with a serious expression. _"It's going to get more dangerous from here on out."_

_"That's exactly why I'm chronicling this! It's the most exciting part!"_ the gnome's voice chimes in with mild excitement. _"The Orcs are why we're here, after all,"_ she snorts, chuckling to herself.

_"But we've got the mighty [[Aldith Tresendar|Black Hawk]], hero of the [[World History#The Foundry Wars|Foundry wars]], to protect us,"_ the elf smirks.

_"Well, let's just try not to get in his way and make him save us,"_ she says, her tone playfully sarcastic. The elf then nods toward the projection. _"What is that, anyway?"_

_"This? This is a pixie, eh? Millipickle pix?"_ the gnome mumbles.

_"A what?"_ the elf asks, looking puzzled.

_"Don't dwell on it. No good will come of it,"_ another, more [[Boggle Figgle-Wiggits|masculine gnome]] voice interjects. The image swings around to show a gnome in a brimmed black hat and long leather robe, engrossed in a book, clearly uninterested in conversation.

_"You shut it!"_ [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits|the girl gnome]] snaps back.

_"Um, how about [[Pickle]]? That seems more fun to say,"_ the elf offers, trying to lighten the mood.

_"[[Pickle]]! I like that! How do you like that? [[Pickle]]!"_ The projection turns back to the dirty-faced gnome, who flashes a big bucktoothed grin.

Suddenly, loud war horns blare in the distance.

_"[[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits|Toggle]]!"_ a deep voice roars. [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits|The gnome girl]] reacts, looking away from the projection.

_"Watch out!"_ the same voice thunders. The projection drops to the ground, now pointing slightly skyward. In a quick blur, a massive, hulking figure with deep green skin darts past, followed by a loud crunch. The image abruptly cuts off.
