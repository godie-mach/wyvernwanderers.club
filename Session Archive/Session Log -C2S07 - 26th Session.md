## Session Summary (Transcribed)
Levana has a symbol on her forehead, in infernal. Sarhiri is able to translate: "I speak the words to the Lords of the nine hells to banish this protector so the child may walk alone." 

We teleport back to town with help from [[Tempest]]. [[Tempest]] bitches at Kreeble for assuming she's a slave. 
The gang heads over to the party, [[Godric Gallavant Grimor|Godric]] leads a toast. Kreeble pounds a few beers, Rowan picks him up and we head over to the [[Sleeping Giant Pub]], where we are given lodging. 
Sarhiri meets with her brother, who expresses concern for the journey she's embarking on. Her brother hands her a potion, she hugs him and he walks away. 
Clank rests and experiences a vivid dream.
Clank, Louie (tiefling), and Tuck are there to find the Cat's Tear of the Dreamweaver. THey sneak through the Duke's home while there is a party outside. They enter what appears to be the Duke's room, that's more like a suite (large fireplace, giant militaristic portrait of him, large pelts over the bed and couch). Clank recalls talking to a buyer, asking for the Duke's diary. We look through the duke's desk, and find his ledger. We also look through the nightstand and mattress for his diary. We find a loose marble tile and find a book, black with a locket. Tuck gets caught by the guards, and smokepowder fills the room. This allows Clank to jump back into the window sill and across giant party balloons. Clank evades capture and hear a blue tiefling asking for help behind a gate. Clank attempts to unlock the gate, hears a chink assuming the gate is unlocked so Clank makes a run for it. Once Clank escapes, he thinks about the uncertainty: what happened to Tuck? Louie? Bactu? A hooded figure appears and asks for his request: diary and ledger. Clank hands over the diary and asks for double the pay for the ledger. The hooded figure lunges with a scimitar, Clank avoids the cut, but feels a crash against his skull. Clank pulls out crossbow and fires, sinking into the figure. Seizing the opportunity, Clank escapes into the sewers. Clank hears "I will find you, gnome. No shadow in Xeno can hide you forever."

Rowan wakes up early and walks over to [Linene] to get his sword upgraded. [[Mung and Drool|Mung]] talks to Rowan. Sarhiri walks back to the inn after spending the night with Godric's crew. Sarhiri mentions she saw one of the Rockseeker brothers with a griffin on her way over. She walks us back to the [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]. Nundro and Tharden will fly out ahead and scout ahead of us. They gave us the beacon stone that will sound when we're ready to meet (~4-5 days). 

A bird flies over Levana. The bird drops a note, the note says: "To my fierce beauty, I hope it is not bold of me to put my thoughts to parchment. Our time together has put a mark on my ehart that is hard to ignore. Not only did you slay a dragon but you conquered my heart. I will cherish the time we shared and will forever hold dear the time we shared. Enclosed is a frost blossom. I symbol of beauty in resilience, much like you. Even if our paths never cross again bla bla love love." Since Kreeble is unaware of the history, Kreeble uses speak to animal to speak to the dove. The dove tells him his keeper is Rockgar. Kreeble asks the dove for a favor, "I need you to hang out with us for a while and scout the road ahead." The dove declines, as it is extremely loyal to its keeper. 

Sarhiri calls over to her brother, Salazar. "Are you venturing off now?" her brother asks. She asks her brother for transportation. Her brother is offended, as this is against all of their customs. Godric, however, comes over and instructs Salazar to escort them. 

The ship is a pear-shaped vessel, Raijin 0022. There are pantalooned dragonborns using stone tablets to, presumably, manage and run the ship. After some travel time, the ship arrives in a clearing. While we cannot see the Hotenow tribe yet, we see the terrain is becoming hilly. We heard a sharp yip and suddenly see tribal folks surround us. Hotenow tribe, they use horses and elephant size tortoises.
