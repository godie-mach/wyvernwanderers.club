## Session Summary (Transcribed)

As they approach [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|the green dragon]]'s tower, [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] decides to scout ahead. Transforming into a mid-sized giant spider, she stealthily climbs to the top of the tower and finds the dragon asleep, nestled among its horde. Scanning the treasure, she notices an ornate oaken staff lying close to the dragon's claws. As she inches closer, she accidentally makes a noise, rousing the dragon.

_“SPIDERS? DISGUSTING PESTS!”_ the dragon snarls, releasing a blast of poisonous acid directly at her. The impact flings [[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] off the tower's edge, the acid burning away her spider form and forcing her back into her true shape as she plummets down, now a tall half-elf in free fall. The elf falls onto the group, breaking her descent.

[[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] quickly tells them about [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|the green dragon]]'s horde and the staff she saw as they prepare themselves to face the beast. Disguised as cultists, the party approaches the dragon. 

[[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]], the imposing green dragon, narrows his gaze and growls, _“Leave the food. I have no appetite.”_ The party tries to coax him into eating the poisoned meal, but before they can press further, a [[masked figure]] suddenly appears, snatching the ornate oaken staff from the dragon's horde.

[[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]] roars in fury, swiping at the masked figure, who evades each strike, flipping and leaping with astonishing agility until they cling to the tower's ledge. With the dragon distracted, the masked figure glances at the party and nods, saying in a gravelly tone, _“Thanks for the diversion. Keeping this beast busy helped a lot.”_ With that, they flip backward, disappearing in a cloud of smoke.

Now enraged, [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]] turns on the party. _“You dare to trick [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]]? You will pay for your insolence.”_ He inhales, releasing a torrent of acid directly at them. [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] takes the full brunt of the attack, collapsing unconscious as an inky black substance begins to seep from her chest. The dark essence envelops her, rapidly expanding into an enormous form, growing massive wings, beast-like limbs, a horned head, and a long neck. Emerging from the inky shroud is a colossal black dragon, dwarfing [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]].

[[The Adventurers#Levana|The black dragon]] lets out a bellowing roar and unleashes a torrent of black, fire-laden sludge, terrifying [[Venom Fang, the green dragon|Venom Fang]], who quickly flees from the tower. But the weight and chaos of their battle cause the tower to rumble, starting to collapse. [[The Adventurers#Levana|The black dragon]]'s fiery sludge splatters dangerously close, burning some party members as they scramble to escape. They leap from the crumbling tower as it falls in ruins behind them, barely making it to safety.

At the foot of the wreckage, the party looks up to see [[The Adventurers#Levana|the black dragon]] shrieking, flying off in a rampage. Suddenly, [[Reidoth]] approaches, handing them the [[Harrow Root]]. He mutters, _“That staff must still be in the wreckage somewhere.”_ The party, shaken but determined, sets off to find [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], now transformed into a monstrous dragon form, hoping they can save their friend before it's too late.
