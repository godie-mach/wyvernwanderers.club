## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The following morning, the party leaves the inn to find [[The Redbrand]] guards systematically searching house to house. An old woman approaches the group, smiling as she steps up to [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] and offers him a fortune. She asks him to close his eyes, and as he obliges, she suddenly whacks him on the head with her walking stick.

Her voice shifts into a familiar, masculine tone. _"What a fool!"_ the old woman exclaims. _"Releasing a prisoner and then shooting him in the leg afterward? What were you thinking?"_ She reveals herself in a hushed whisper, adding, _"It's me, [[Darren Eldermath]]. The Redbrands are now on patrol, looking for both you lot and me. Mixing up with you was a mistake. Come on, follow me to my farm. It's much safer there than standing out in the open like this."_

Back at [[Darren Eldermath]]'s farm, the party explains their plan to reach the [[Tresendar Manor|abandoned mansion]] on the outskirts of town. [[Darren Eldermath]] warns that getting to the mansion will be tricky, as the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] are on high alert. However, he suggests the party wear disguises to get close, while he creates a diversion at the [[Sleeping Giant Pub]] by setting it on fire to draw attention away from the mansion. The party agrees, and the plan is set in motion.

As they approach the [[Tresendar Manor|abandoned mansion]], they overhear two [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] thugs guarding the crumbling gates, exchanging stories about whether the place is truly haunted. When the explosion from [[Darren Eldermath]]â€™s diversion at the [[Sleeping Giant Pub]] echoes in the distance, the party seizes the opportunity and swiftly takes down the distracted guards.

They regroup with [[Darren Eldermath]], who explains that he escaped by retreating into the underground tunnels and collapsing them behind him, successfully evading the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]].
