## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party tumbles down a shaft, crashing onto the dirt floor below. The stranger floats down gracefully, as light as a feather, and lands softly on his feet.

_"I guess this calls for my introduction,"_ he says, pulling out a banjo strapped to his back and beginning to strum lightly. _"Nice to meet you. I'm [[Darren Eldermath]], the one you'll admire. My gifts are like a siren's call, pulling you higher. But don't get too close. I'm more than you know. I hold all the power, and you'll never let go."_

He sings and strums the last line repeatedly, but the party just stares at him in bafflement. He smacks his tongue and adds, _"I guess I'm a little rusty on my showmanship."_

Darren informs the group that he lives in town after inheriting his uncle's farm. He planned to retire in this small town after many adventures, but his last escapade left him on the short end of the stick, pointing to his eye and flashing a smile full of silver and gold.

_"Everything was going well until [[Pytr|the last mayor]] disappeared and [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin Wester]] took his place. Not long after that, [[The Redbrand]] showed up, and now everything is in ruin. Maybe your arrival is a sign from the heavens that a change is coming."_

He continues, _"That's why I intervened. I tend to follow my gut. It served me well, and even saved my hide,"_ he says, with a chuckle. _"Well, follow me. We should get going. These caverns aren't in the best shape, and a loud noise could attract the giant spiders that patrol these halls."_
