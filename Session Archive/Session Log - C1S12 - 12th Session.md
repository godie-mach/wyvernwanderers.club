## Session Summary (Transcribed)

After a tense exchange, the party convinces the halfling, who introduces himself as [[Aldo]], to question his allegiance. They argue that the [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] should not be mere pawns for higher forces but should act of their own volition. Moved by their words, [[Aldo]] agrees. Despite some [[The Redbrand|redbrand]] members protesting, [[Aldo]] commands them to release the prisoners and head back to the docks in Neverwinter.

Before he departs, the party mentions that [[Halleah]] is looking for him. [[Aldo]] nods, saying, _“If she wants to find me, she can meet me in the Neverwinter forest in three days.”_

The conscious dwarf rushes over to [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]]. _“[[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]]? What are you doing here? Where's [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]]?”_ he asks, his voice thick with worry. [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] quickly brings him up to speed, recounting everything that's happened since they last met. 

[[Nundro Rockseeker]]’s eyes narrow, and he shakes his head. _“Damn, our father's stories really got to that boy's head!”_ he mutters. _“As if I didn’t have enough looking out to do with just one brother.”_

He approaches the unconscious dwarf and shifts the limp figure onto his shoulders with a grunt. _“Come on, [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]],”_ he says as he steadies himself under the weight. _“Let's get you patched up.”_

Turning to [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] and the rest of the party, [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] nods, _“I’ll see you all back in town.”_ With a final nod to [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], he heads out of the cave, carrying [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] with him, leaving the party alone in the dim cavern.

The rest of the party turns to [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], questioning her about her familiarity with the dwarves. She hesitates before coming clean, explaining that she met the three brothers—[[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]], and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]—some time ago in the [Underdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark). They had rescued her from a drow kingdom where she’d been held captive.

[[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] reveals that [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] made her promise to keep their connection secret, as he couldn’t fully trust anyone he hired. He feared they might be working for a mysterious figure known as [[The Black Spider]], who seemed intent on tracking him down for reasons unknown.

With this new understanding, the party wraps up their exploration and leaves the caverns of [[Tresendar Manor]].
