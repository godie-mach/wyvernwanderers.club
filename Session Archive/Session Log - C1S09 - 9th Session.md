## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party cautiously explores the mansion, investigating each room, though some areas are blocked off. They eventually stumble upon a [[Squad Inventory#***Inventory ***|bag of holding]]. After uncovering a hidden passage, the party descends into the [[Tresendar Manor|mansion]]'s basement, where more mysteries await. As they make their way through narrow corridors, they stumble upon a makeshift prison. Breaking into one of the cells, they find a creature chained to the wall, its arms bound and hanging limply. 

_"[[Pytr]]!"_ [[Darren Eldermath]] exclaims in shock. The creature resembles a massive cat with salt and pepper fur and a long beard like tuft on its snout. Most strikingly, it has seven matted tales that have clearly seen better days. [[Darren Eldermath]] explains that [[Pytr]] was once the mayor of [[Phandalin]] before he mysteriously vanished. [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]] had since taken control, claiming [[Pytr]] had left him in charge. 

_"What have they done to you? Oh, your arm."_ He gasps, noticing [[Pytr]]'s forearm and hand are missing. Crudely bandaged. [[Darren Eldermath]] frees [[Pytr]] from his chains, gently easing him to the ground as the creature lets out a soft groan.

_"I'm going to take him back to town, nurse him back to health. Gods. I hope it's not too late."_ [[Darren Eldermath]] says solemnly, lifting [[Pytr]] onto his back. _"Hold on [[Pytr]]. Just a bit longer."_ With urgency, [[Darren Eldermath]] carries him out disappearing into the shadows of the basement.
