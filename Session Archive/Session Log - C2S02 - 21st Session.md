## Session Summary (Transcribed)

Sounds projected from Pickle's eyes, blurry and difficult to make out. _"Ah, finally, got it back to work."_ An image appears of a familiar [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits|young rock gnome girl's]] face.

_"There you go. At least I got the records part running again. [[Aldith Tresendar|Aldith]] needs to watch ways walking with those big steppers next time,"_ says [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits|the gnome girl]]. Her face moves away, revealing a campsite in a rustic village. The village, with its orc-ish aesthetic, is nestled in a mountainous setting characterized by tan hides and leather tents. A group forms a half-circle around a secluded campfire.

_"Well, he was protecting you,"_ a brash voice comes from a [[Lox|figure with a mohawk]] at the other end of the campfire who is sharpening a long dagger. _"Toys have no use on the battlefield. You knew we were going into orc territory, and it was going to be dangerous. You're lucky that was the only thing that got broken."_

_"I don't need reminding that this quest is dangerous, and I can take care of myself, thank you very mooch. Us Figgle-Wiggits don't need help from the great Black Hawk."_

_"Right? Woodl?"_ The other gnome at the other end of the campsite looks up from his book, shaking his head as he tries to avoid the conversation.

_"He should know that bitty creatures shouldn't be treated like dumb-dumb children. Anyway, this is no simple toy. This is a significant piece of tinkering that your dumb-dumb mind could never comprehend. It will catch our capers in ways no song could ever have."_

[[Lox|The mohawk figure]] returns to sharpening her blades. _"Hard to tell you two are sisters, let alone twins,"_ the [[Toggle Figgle-Wiggits|gnome girl]] says to a [[Cassia|half-elf druid]] sitting next to her.

_"Half!"_ [[Lox|the mohawk figure]] yells.

_"Yes, we are half-sisters and twins only by the day of birth, not like you and [[Boggle Figgle-Wiggits|Boggle]],"_ the [[Cassia|druid]] gestures to the gnome reading the book.

_"Strange customs you forest children and mountain humes have. Gnomes are known to have big families, usually from the same 'Boo-Dops,' (gnomish for parents)"_ the gnome girl retorts.

_"Yes, that custom is also strange for the children of Silvanus, but my 'Boo-Daps' were arranged to unify the land in a way,"_ [[Cassia|the druid]] replies, glancing at [[Lox|the mohawk figure]] who is silently sharpening her blade and trying to stay out of the conversation.

_"Yet [[Lox]] can be a little rough at times, but she is the finest warrior of the [[Hotenow Tribe]]. I wouldn't want another escort by my side for protection. Unlike the Figgle-Wiggits, I do need help from time to time,"_ she says to the gnome with a soft smile.

A dwarven figure walks up to the group, looking exactly like [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]. _"[[Thaddoc]]! Where's [[Aldith Tresendar|Aldith]]?"_ the druid asks, her smile fading into a concerned expression.

_"Come, the leader of this clan requested to meet us all,"_ the dwarf says in a calm but concerning voice.
