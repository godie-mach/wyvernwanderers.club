## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party rests for the day and meets back up at [[The Luck Shrine]], where they encounter a stern shrine patron named [[Garaele|Sister Garaele]]. She guides them to the Dwarf Brothers' room. Upon entering, they find both brothers ([[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]) and [[Syldar Hallwinter]] in a modest room set up with a small makeshift chemistry station and a peculiar creature—a mix of various animals—watching from the corner.

_“Oh, just the ones I wanted to see. I could use your help,”_ [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] begins. He recounts how he and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] were scouting the base of the [[Sword Mountains]] when they were ambushed by a clan of orcs. They barely escaped with their lives, but while trying to regroup, [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] was struck by a poisoned dart that cast him into a deep, magical sleep. Although [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] managed to dodge the darts, they were soon overtaken by [[The Redbrand|redbrands]] and captured. Now, [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] remains in an endless sleep from which nothing has yet been able to wake him.

[[Garaele|Sister Garaele]] informs them that [[Harrow Root]] could break the spell, but that it is a seasonal plant growing only in harsh conditions. However, she adds that they are in luck. A shrewd druid has recently established an encampment in the old abandoned druid town of [[Thundertree]].

[[The Adventurers#Seshat|Seshat]] recognizes the name of the druid, [[Reidoth]], recalling him as her Botany 101 instructor during her first year at Druid College. She remembers he was dismissed for “fraternizing” with students and for selling herbal creations on the side. [[Syldar Hallwinter]] also informs the group that he has a lead on [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]]'s whereabouts, though there are still details to uncover.

This delay gives the party time to undertake the journey to [[Thundertree]] in search of the [[Harrow Root]]. Before they leave, [[Syldar Hallwinter]] thanks them for finding [[Urno Albrek|Urno]], who is currently recovering at [[The Luck Shrine]]. The party agrees and prepares to set off for [[Thundertree]].

Just before embarking on their journey, they go to [[Halleah]]'s office, where they find her packing for a trip. They inform her that [[Aldo]] will be waiting for her in the woods near Neverwinter. She smiles and pays the group for their assistance before bidding them farewell.
