## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party escorts the caravan along the road to [[Phandalin]]. The journey is uneventful until they stumble upon the aftermath of an attack. Upon investigation, they discover that [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] and [[Syldar Hallwinter]] were the victims. Just as they make this realization, the group is ambushed by a gang of goblins. 

After defeating the goblin raiders, the party follows their trail to locate the goblin hideout in search of [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] and [[Syldar Hallwinter]]. Eventually, they find [[Syldar Hallwinter]] captured by the goblins. Once freed, he reveals that during their night ride toward [[Phandalin]], they encountered a little girl who begged for help. Although [[Syldar Hallwinter]] had advised against intervening, [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] chose to assist her. Unfortunately, the girl transformed into a creature that [[Syldar Hallwinter]] couldn't recognize, leading to [[Syldar Hallwinter]] being ambushed and separated from [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]]. [[Syldar Hallwinter]] suggests that the group regroup in [[Phandalin]] to plan their next steps during their adventure. 

The party also encounters a [[Mung and Drool|young goblin girl]] who has been mistreated by the goblins while caring for the wargs used for security. They invite the shy goblin girl and her wargs to join them on their journey back to [[Phandalin]], and she introduces herself as [[Mung and Drool|Mung]].
