## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The party follows the trail of destruction left by [[The Adventurers#Levana|the black dragon]], eventually arriving at a small village engulfed in eerie inky flames. Amid the devastation, they encounter a towering man with violet eyes and fiery red hair. He introduces himself as [[Wyre]], the clan leader of this village.

He explains that the death dragon appeared without warning, laying waste to his village and attacking his people and livestock. [[Wyre]] gestures to a young girl lying nearby, covered in dark burns. 

_“My daughter,”_ he says somberly. _“She was attacked by the black ooze the dragon unleashed. I stayed behind to search for her, but the rest of the village... I don’t know if anyone else survived. I sent as many as I could to flee with their families and livestock.”_

[[Wyre]] recounts his encounter with the dragon. It seemed ready to attack him but suddenly veered off, disappearing into the [[Mount Hotenow]] forest beyond his view. As they speak, a thick, bubbling form oozes from the shadows—a black pudding summoned by the dragon's lingering essence. It lunges at the party, and [[Wyre]], seething with grief and fury, raises his weapon to join them in battle.

After fending off the black pudding, the party hurries into the [[Mount Hotenow]] forest, desperate to track down their friend. As they leave, [[Wyre]] warns them about the dangers lurking within. 

_“Stay on the main paths,”_ he cautions, _“and don’t wander too deep. The forest is cursed; those who stray too close to the summit risk becoming petrified, and something deadly hunts in these woods—the Drock, as we call it.”_

He spits at the name, a flash of anger in his eyes. Bidding them farewell, [[Wyre]] gathers his injured daughter in his arms, and with one last look back, leaves the party to their mission as he returns to salvage what's left of his village.
