## Session Summary (Transcribed)

The scene opens in a dimly lit cave. An orc-ish line stands on one side, while in the center looms a stone throne. A giant orc sits at the edge, his hands closed at the tips of each finger.

_"So,"_ [[Zog Bloodfang|the orc on the throne]] bellows, _"I'm told you wanted a council with me, something dire that could affect my tribe."_ He chuckles to himself, a low growl escaping his throat.

[[Cassia|The lady druid]] steps forward, her voice stern. _"I am [[Cassia]], high priestess of the [[Thundertree]] tribe and heir to the chief of the [[Hotenow Tribe]]. I bring an urgent message. A major calamity has taken hold of [[Mount Hotenow]]. Darkness sickens the crags of the mountains; it will soon erupt and cast its shadow across the woods and the Sword Coast. I plead with you to allow my party to investigate the caverns of the [[Sword Mountains]]. We believe the answer to defeating this darkness lies within."_

A growling chuckle escapes [[Zog Bloodfang|the giant warlord]]. _"You think a darkness frightens us, beastmen?"_ All the orcs laugh at this thought. _"We thrive in darkness."_ The orc rises, towering over [[Cassia]], his body chiseled from stone and adorned with scars. He steps closer, brushing his knuckle against her cheek. _"Any soot that will come from [[Mount Hotenow]] won't reach the peaks of the sword. Unlike your soft flesh, our skin is honed by the sharp oar of the sword. We can withstand any calamity far better than you."_

_"You do not understand. Please listen!"_ [[Cassia]] screams.

_"I'm done listening,"_ [[Zog Bloodfang|the orc]] roars, his voice echoing through the hall. _"I'm bored of your fire tales."_ He turns sharply, nodding to a large orc nearby. _"Goodbye, priestess."_

As the giant orc steps away, the line of orcs behind the throne readies their weapons.

_"Stop, beast-king!"_ a [[Aldith Tresendar|man in black armor]] calls, halting the orc in his tracks. _"If we can't persuade you with caution, how about treasures or trinkets?"_ [[Aldith Tresendar|the black knight]] steps closer. _"We are building a forge that can produce treasures and magic the likes of which this land has not seen."_

_"We do not need treasure. What we need is given to us from the sword, not greedy trinkets that lowland creatures fight over,"_ the orc retorts, still facing away.

_"You're right. No mere trinkets are useful for beastmen. But there is something far more powerful that can cut through you. I've seen it firsthand. This power can protect your people and strengthen your clan. No beast or dragon can stand against it."_

[[Aldith Tresendar|The black knight]] glances at the dwarf beside him.

_"[[Aldith Tresendar|Aldith]], are you in your right mind?"_ [[Thaddoc]] says sharply, concern etched on his face.

[[Aldith Tresendar|The black knight]] shakes his head. _"We have no other choice."_ Intrigued, the orc turns around. [[Thaddoc]] reaches into his beard, pulling out a glimmering stone that briefly distorts the air around it. The knight takes the stone from the dwarf.

_"This is aethercite. I've witnessed its power on the front lines of the [[World History#The Foundry Wars|Foundry Wars]]. The forge we will build can produce this stone. We can offer some of the aethercite we create to you and your clan as payment, a gesture of union."_ He raises the stone as he walks toward the orc.

_"Aldith!"_ [[Thaddoc]] yells, but [[Aldith Tresendar|the black knight]] ignores him.

[[Aldith Tresendar|The black knight]] hands the stone to [[Zog Bloodfang|the orc]], who pinches it between his thumb and index finger, making it look like a mere pebble in his grasp. The stone shines brightly in the orc's face as he gazes deeply into it. The orc gestures to [[Krog|another orc wearing a grand headdress]] adorned with feathers and bones, tribal markings covering his body. They whisper to one another.

[[Zog Bloodfang|The beast lord]] steps closer to [[Aldith Tresendar|the black knight]], bending down until they are face to face. Silence fills the hall.

_"Harth,"_ growls the orc.

_"Deal,"_ [[Aldith Tresendar|the black knight]] responds.

_"Al!"_ screams [[Thaddoc]], but [[Aldith Tresendar|the black knight]] ignores him. _"For this arrangement, I will send one of my clan to aid you,"_ the orc says softly. _"[[Zog Bloodfang|Zog]], you can't be serious with these lies from these feeble creatures,"_ howls an orc in the back.

_"Quiet! I have not asked for your council, [[Krog]],"_ the orc lord bellows. _"[[Gurk Bloodfang|Gurk]], my son will join you. Use him for any assistance in your search or the construction of the forge."_ He waves over a smaller orc. The smaller orc trots over, appearing younger with most of his head shaved except for a braided ponytail hanging behind him. He nods to [[Aldith Tresendar|the black knight]].

_"We shall seal this agreement like beastmen,"_ [[Zog Bloodfang|the orc]] says proudly. The knight nods. The orc head-butts [[Aldith Tresendar|the black knight]], who braces himself for the impact. As they lock heads, the beast lord says, _"So, the tales of the [[Aldith Tresendar|Black Hawk]] are true. Once the forge is made, you can tell fire tales of your trials in the Foundry Wars."_

_"I will look forward to it,"_ the [[Aldith Tresendar|Black Hawk]] responds.
