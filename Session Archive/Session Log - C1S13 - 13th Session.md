## Session Summary (Transcribed)

Upon returning to town in the early morning, the party finds a crowd gathered in the town square, a commotion brewing at its center. Pushing their way through, they see [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]] confronting [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin Wester]].

_“You bastard!”_ [[Darren]] roars, fury blazing in his eyes. _“[[Pytr]] told me everything. How you were in league with [[The Redbrand]], controlling this town, capturing him in the dead of night, keeping him in the basement of [[Tresendar Manor]]. I’ll see you pay for every crime.”_

[[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]]’s face drains of color. _“No, please, it wasn’t my fault. [[Urno Albrek|Glass staff]] forced me into it. He threatened me if I didn’t fund him and [[The Redbrand]]. I didn’t know they kept [[Pytr]] there, let alone did that to him. I thought they just made him disappear. You have to believe me,”_ he pleads, sinking to his knees.

The party steps in to defuse the tension. [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] appeals to [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]], suggesting that rather than taking immediate retribution, they should hold [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]] captive and put him on trial to answer for his crimes. [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]] reluctantly agrees, muttering about [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]]’s wealthy uncle likely bailing him out once he hears of this. He binds [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]]’s hands and marches him off to his farm to be held until further notice.

Before departing, [[Darren Eldermath|Darren]] tells the party to visit [[The Luck Shrine]], mentioning that the dwarf brothers and [[Pytr]] are currently staying there. He adds that they may even offer the party free lodging as thanks for their help.
