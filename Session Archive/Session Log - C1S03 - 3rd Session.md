## Session Summary (Transcribed)

As the party enters the small and humble town of [[Phandalin]], they notice several people dressed in crimson harassing the local folk. The party feels the eyes of the [[The Redbrand|crimson clad band]] watching their caravan as they make their way to a small barn outpost. There, they are greeted by a half orc named [[Elmer]], who orders his nephews, Ufus and Doofus, to unload the caravan and prepare the goods for [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] and his brothers [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]].

[[Elmer]] expresses concern, mentioning that he hasn't heard from [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] or [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] since they went on a brief scouting trip to the [[Sword Mountains]], where orc attacks have recently increased. He promises to hold their gear until they return. [[Syldar Hallwinter]] turns to the group after they've taken a look around town, and instructs them to meet him back at [[The Luck Shrine]]. He needs time to meditate on his next move to find [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]]. 

The party makes its way to the center of town, where they come across a stocky, strong, armed woman with thick leather gloves and a face smudged with soot. She's speaking loudly her leather clad finger jabbing into the chest of a portly, soft looking bald man with a mustache and mutton chops, dressed in what might once have been an expensive emerald jacket. His arm is raised defensively, trying to calm her down.

_"You're supposed to be the mayor"_, the woman says, her voice dripping with sarcasm. _"You need to deal with these hoodlums harassing our town."_ 

Sweat beads heavily on the mayor's forehead as he responds. _"Now, [[Linene]], please. you must understand, yes, these men are a bit brash, but times are hard with the rise of orc and goblin attacks. We need their added protection. Just try to accommodate them. They're risking their lives as the first line of defense. It's stressful work, and they're just blowing off a little steam. That's all steam."_ 

She yells her frustration, boiling over. _"I'll show you steam, you fat fool."_ She trembles with barely contained anger, resisting the urge to punch the pudgy man in the face with a furious stomp, she storms off her thick leather and steel bound boots, kicking up dust with every step. 

The mustachioed man lets out a sigh of relief as she walks away, dabbing his brow with a striped handkerchief pulled from his front pocket, the man notices the party and quickly shifts his demeanor, putting on a cheerful expression. 

_"Welcome, welcome!"_ He exclaims, gesturing to the town around him. _"Welcome to our quaint little town of [[Phandalin]]!"_ With a smile, he adds: _"You must be the group that just escorted our Dwarven visitors luggage."_ He smirks. _"Word travels fast in these parts, we're a tight knit community. Mostly miners and farmers, but I assure you, this town will grow on you during your stay. I'm the mayor, [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin Wester]]."_ he says, giving the party a small bow. _"And welcome to my town!"_ 

He glances toward the direction [[Linene]] stormed off in. _"Don't mind [[Linene]]. She's a little rough around the edges, but she's the best blacksmith you'll find around here."_ [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]] proceeds to point out key locations in the small town. He mentions that the people dressed in red are called [[The Redbrand]], and they're here to protect the town from invading creatures. 

_"If you need anything from them, you can find them at the [[Sleeping Giant Pub]]."_ After a long winding greeting, the soft spoken [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]] nods to the group and hopes they enjoy their stay in [[Phandalin]]. 

The party makes their way to the blacksmith shop, where [[Linene]] is still trying to cool down after her confrontation with [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]]. She's short tempered with the group, but softens slightly when she notices a [[Mung and Drool|little goblin girl]] among them. The party strikes a deal with [[Linene]]. She agrees to take in [[Mung and Drool|Mung]] and look after her and her works. [[Mung and Drool|Mung]] is overjoyed. She gives the party a big hug before going over to [[Linene]], who immediately begins assigning her tasks. 

Before the party departs, [[Linene]] calls out: _"If you could try reasoning with [[The Redbrand]], since [[Mayor Harbin Wester|Harbin]] won't, that'd be a good enough gesture to thank me for taking in [[Mung and Drool|Mung]]."_ 

With that, she returns to her work and the party leaves the shop.
