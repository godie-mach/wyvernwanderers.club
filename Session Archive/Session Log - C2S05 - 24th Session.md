## Session Summary (Transcribed)

_"Did you really think [[Piggie]] was anything more than a fool’s disguise?"_ [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]] sneers. _"You’re all so predictable. Now, let’s have some fun."_

With a snap of his fingers, [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]] pulls a [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]] out of the shadows. The creature is mangy and rotten, its flickering, distorted form an ominous sight in the forest clearing.

[[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]], still groggy and in pain from the mushrooms, draws his longsword and takes a defensive stance. [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]], calm and collected, nocks an arrow and lets it fly toward [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]], but he counters with a potion from his seemingly endless supply, healing himself instantly.

_"You think that’ll stop me? I have all the time in the world,"_ [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]] taunts, downing another potion and tossing the empty bottle aside.

The [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]] lunges, its flickering form difficult to track. Its tentacles lash out at [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]], who parries one with his sword but takes a deep gash to his side from the other. He grits his teeth and channels a bit of healing energy into himself to keep standing.

[[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] switches tactics, drawing her dual blades and slashing at the beast with calculated precision. One of her strikes connects, tearing through its mangy hide, but the creature is unnaturally resilient, and [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]]’s potions keep it alive.

[[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]], nimble as ever, darts into the shadows of the trees, loading his crossbow. He fires a bolt at [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]], striking him in the shoulder. _"Ha! Didn’t see that coming, did you?"_ [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] quips, but [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]] simply gulps down another potion, the wound closing before their eyes.

_"Enough games!"_ [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]] growls, hurling a crackling bolt of dark energy toward [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]]. The gnome rogue flips out of the way just in time, landing behind a fallen log and immediately lining up another shot.

[[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] moves in close, slashing at the displacer beast to draw its attention away from [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]]. His sword glows faintly as he smites the creature, leaving it staggered. [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] follows up with a spell, a burst of radiant energy that briefly forces the displacer beast into its true form, making it easier to hit.

_"I can’t keep this up forever!"_ [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] shouts, blood seeping through his armor.

_"You don’t have to,"_ [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] replies, firing another arrow that grazes [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]]. _"Just hold on a little longer."_

As the displacer beast turns its focus to Levana, [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] emerges from the shadows once more, his crossbow aimed with deadly precision. He fires a bolt directly into the beast’s chest. The creature lets out a horrible screech before collapsing into a pool of goo, its twisted form melting into the ground.

With his beast defeated, [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]]’s smug expression falters. _"You insignificant pests!"_ he roars, pulling out yet another potion. Before he can drink it, [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] bolts forward, snatching the bottle from [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]]’s hand. [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]] stumbles backward, his bravado replaced with panic.

Suddenly, a swirling black portal appears behind him, and from it emerges a masked individual. It clamps onto [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]]’s face, muffling his screams.

_"No! I can still beat them! I can—"_ [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]]’s voice cuts off as the mask pulls him into the portal. He kicks and flails, but it’s futile. The portal closes with a low hum, leaving nothing behind but the shattered potion bottles and the faint echo of [[Maestro Grobro Fibblestipp|Gobro]]’s last scream.

As the clearing falls silent, [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] slumps to the ground, panting heavily. [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] leans on his sword, bloodied but alive, while [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] scans the area for any further threats.

The pool of goo left by the [[Gobro's Displacer Beast|displacer beast]] seeps into the earth, leaving an unsettling stain on the ground.

_"What... just happened?"_ [[The Adventurers#Rowan|Rowan]] asks, his voice heavy with exhaustion.

_"Whatever it was, it’s gone now,"_ [[The Adventurers#Levana|Levana]] replies. She looks to [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]], who flashes a tired grin. _"Nice shot."_

_"All in a day’s work,"_ [[The Adventurers#Clank|Clank]] says, though his legs shake as he tries to stand.

The group regathers, shaken but alive, with more questions than answers.

## Scratchpad / Notes
Gobro appears where Piggie was standing, along with a zombie-like displacer beast. Displacer beast is defeated, but prior to defeating Gobro, a masked pops out of a portal and grabs Gobro back. Gobro kicks and screams, insisting he can do it, but alas he is taken by the masked. THe displacer beast turns into this goo-like substance. However, it feels like a piece of jerky when touched. Someone in the science field may be able to help analyze it further.
